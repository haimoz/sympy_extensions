1. Function Expressions

   Some computations in SymPy are carried out immediately, e.g.,
   `lcm`, `gcd`, and `prime`.
   There is no chance for substitution and delayed computations.
   Suppose we need to calculate the L.C.M. (least common divisor) of x and y,
   but can only substitute their actual values at a later time,
   this is not achievable in the SymPy proper:

   ```python
   >>> lcm(x, y)
   xâ‹…y
   >>> lcm(x, y).subs({x:6, y:9})
   54
   >>> lcm(6, 9)
   18
   ```

   The function expressions of these computations
   are named `Lcm`, `Gcd`, and `Prime` respectively.
   They allow for delayed computation and substitution.
   They currently only support `subs` and `evalf` methods:

   ```python
   >>> from sympy_extensions import Lcm
   >>> Lcm(x, y)
   Lcm(y, x)
   >>> Lcm(x, y).subs({x:6, y:9})
   Lcm(6, 9)
   >>> Lcm(x, y).evalf(subs={x:6, y:9})
   18.0000000000000
   ```
